<div>Are you a content creator looking for copyright-free songs to play in the back of your videos and livestreams, but don't want to go through the hassle of constantly searching songs for hours looking for the perfect selection?</div>
  <p></p>
<div>Don't worry! We did all of that for you (no seriously, this took us four hours) and made a radio station out of it! This is DisChord Music, a 24/7 copyright-free station. You can use all the songs played without worrying of copyright infringement on ANY of your future creations.</div>
<p></p>
<div>However, some songs require credit. The server has more details.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Of course, you don't have to be a content creator to jam along with us. We're always open for listeners!</div>
